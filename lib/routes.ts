/**
 * Day 7 route registry. Each route is its own case study, so unlike a
 * single-case module, there is no shared "CASE" business name here — only
 * the day-level program identity. Route-specific content (e.g. Route 1's
 * GreenStack Hosting case) lives in that route's own lib/routeN.ts.
 *
 * Routes 2 and 3 are still Day 6's case content (DeltaGrid / NovaCore),
 * carried over pending their own Day 7 rebuild — same transitional pattern
 * Day 6 itself used while Route 1 was rebuilt before Routes 2/3.
